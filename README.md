# **Arcade game**
===============================

## Motivation
This project was build in terms of Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Program. The starter code consisted of art assets and game engine. My role was to build all characters: the player, enemies and teleporter.

## Game functionality
In this game you have a player and enemies (Bugs). The goal of the player is to reach the water, without colliding into any one of the enemies. The player can move left, right, up and down. The enemies move in varying speeds on the paved block portion of the scene. Once the player collides with an enemy, the game is reset and the player moves back to the start square. Once the player reaches the water the game is won. During the game time the teleporter can arrive. It moves the player immediately to the water.

## How to play
To start the game, open index.html file in your browser. Use arrows to control the player.
